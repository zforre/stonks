  <h2>Stonks?</h2>

  <p>Stonks is an intentional misspelling of the word "stocks" which is often associated with a surreal meme featuring the character Meme Man standing in front of a picture representing the stock market followed by the caption "Stonks." The picture began seeing use as a reaction image online in jokes about making poor financial decisions.</p>

  <h2>Surreal?</h2>

  <p>Surreal Memes are a subgenre of Ironic Memes that are artistically bizarre in appearance and whose humor derives from their absurd style. Though the difference between Surreal Memes and Deep Fried Memes and Dank Memes is subtle, certain qualities and characters, such as Layers of Irony, Meme Man, Mr. Orange, and a minimalist style, are frequent markers of a Surreal Meme.</p>

All Star
By:Smash Mouth
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
